# behemothscriptv3
Simple language created in TypeScript.


As of currently the language is very limited. As a whole, the language is made for fun. Currently the language includes the following;

Relatively complete function declaration, call, and return system
String data type with built in C format style string manipulation
Integer data type with simple math built in
Exlusive array types
A work-in-progress standard library including many useful core functions
Limited class system
Conditional if, elif, and else statements with logic gates and logical operators (<,>,<=,=<,!=,==)
For loops with break
Limited type checking
Limited type declaration similar to that of TypeScript
Work in progress typedef struct object system with inheritance
