# behemothscriptv3
Simple language created in TypeScript.


As of currently the language is very limited. As a whole, the language is made for fun. Currently the language includes the following;

Relatively complete function declaration, call, and return system\n
String data type with built in C format style string manipulation\n
Integer data type with simple math built in\n
Exlusive array types\n
A work-in-progress standard library including many useful core functions\n
Limited class system\n
Conditional if, elif, and else statements with logic gates and logical operators (<,>,<=,=<,!=,==)\n
For loops with break\n
Limited type checking\n
Limited type declaration similar to that of TypeScript\n
Work in progress typedef struct object system with inheritance\n
